How Works Diaphragm Pump	A diaphragm pump ( also known as a Membrane pump , Air Operated Double Diaphragm Pump ( AODD ) or Pneumatic Diaphragm Pump ) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber , thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves either side of the diaphragm ( check valve , butterfly valves , flap valves , or any other form of shut-off valves ) to pump a fluid .	1
How Works Diaphragm Pump	There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped , and the other in air or hydraulic fluid .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	The diaphragm is flexed , causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical , working through a crank or geared motor drive , or purely mechanical , such as with a lever or handle .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action , and one side of the diaphragm is open to air .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	The diaphragm ( s ) again are flexed , causing the volume to change .	0
How Works Diaphragm Pump	When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased ( the diaphragm moving up ) , the pressure decreases , and fluid is drawn into the chamber .	0

what is global warming not caused by	Reports published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Energy Agency suggest that efforts as of the early 21st century to reduce emissions may be inadequate to meet the UNFCCC 's target .	0
what is raid 1+0	RAID ( redundant array of independent disks , originally redundant array of inexpensive disks ) is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drive components into a logical unit .	0
what is raid 1+0	Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways called `` RAID levels '' , depending on the level of redundancy and performance required .	0
what is raid 1+0	The term `` RAID '' was first defined by David Patterson , Garth A. Gibson , and Randy Katz at the University of California , Berkeley in 1987 .	0
what is raid 1+0	Marketers representing industry RAID manufacturers later attempted to reinvent the term to describe a redundant array of independent disks as a means of disassociating a low-cost expectation from RAID technology .	0
what is raid 1+0	RAID is now used as an umbrella term for computer data storage schemes that can divide and replicate data among multiple physical drives : RAID is an example of storage virtualization and the array can be accessed by the operating system as one single drive .	0
what is raid 1+0	The different schemes or architectures are named by the word RAID followed by a number ( e.g . RAID 0 , RAID 1 ) .	0
what is raid 1+0	Each scheme provides a different balance between the key goals : reliability and availability , performance and capacity .	0
what is raid 1+0	RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable ( sector ) read errors , as well as whole disk failure .	0
