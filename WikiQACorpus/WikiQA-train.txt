how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	The slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch : Roofs which are nearly flat are known as low-pitch roofs ( as the angle of slope increases , so the pitch is said to increase ) .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Any sheet of material used to cover a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof area .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof , though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground , or better , into a specially made soakaway .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area .	0

how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	In warmer climes where rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur , many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	In areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak , or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to 'blowing ' ( breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms ) these roofs are not suitable .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertight .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	The tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the sun 's heat , UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Roof decking is usually of plywood , chipboard or OSB boards ( OSB = Oriented Strand Board , also known as Sterling board ) of around 18mm thickness .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid , heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper ' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled , the gravel is spread evenly over it .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	A main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing , thus exposing it to weather and sun whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets in .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Tarpaper is usually a 'paper ' or fibre material soaked or impregnated in tar .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	As gravel can not protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands , tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel applied to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of gravel is stuck to it in order to give it ongoing protection .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Tarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful results .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic ' tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them , however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	There are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of their performance and availability .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	If a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath it .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	This can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	There are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores : the severity of this health risk remains a debated point .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering ( be it traditional or a modern membrane ) it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Thus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair it .	0
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?	Once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens .	0

How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	This article deals with Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) rather than the rhizotomy procedures for pain relief ; for those procedures , which have begun to take the name `` rhizotomy '' in certain instances , see facet rhizotomy and similar .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	A rhizotomy ( ) is a term chiefly referring to a neurosurgical procedure that selectively destroys problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord , most often to relieve the symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	The selective dorsal rhizotomy ( SDR ) for spastic cerebral palsy has been the main use of rhizotomy for neurosurgeons specialising in spastic CP since the 1980s ; in this surgery , the spasticity-causing nerves are isolated and then targeted and destroyed .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	The sensory nerve roots , where spasticity is located , are first separated from the motor ones , and the nerve fibres to be cut are then identified via electromyographic stimulation .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	The ones producing spasticity are then selectively lesioned with tiny electrical pulses .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	In spasticity , rhizotomy precisely targets and destroys the damaged nerves that don’t receive gamma amino butyric acid , which is the core problem for people with spastic cerebral palsy .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	These over-firing , non-GABA-absorbing nerves generate unusual electrical activity during the EMG testing phase in SDR and are thus considered to be the source of the patient 's hypertonia ; they are eliminated with the electrical pulses once identified , while the remaining nerves and nerve routes carrying the correct messages remain fully intact and untouched .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	This means that the spasticity is permanently dissolved , and that this is done without affecting nervous system sensitivity or function in other areas , because the only nerves destroyed are the over-firing ones responsible for the muscle tightness .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	The terms rhizotomy and neurotomy are also increasingly becoming interchangeable in the treatment of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	This is a procedure called a facet rhizotomy and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing nerve root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	Such radio frequency nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed .	0
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?	A facet rhizotomy is just one of many different forms of radiofrequency ablation , and its use of the `` rhizotomy '' name should not be confused with the SDR procedure .	0

what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor ( BCR ) .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	There are several different types of antibody heavy chains , and several different kinds of antibodies , which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals , which perform different roles , and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	This region is known as the hypervariable region .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .	0
what antibodies are produced in large quantities	This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .	0

how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Events involving meiosis , showing chromosomal crossover	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Meiosis ( ) is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	In many organisms , including all animals and land plants ( but not some other groups such as fungi ) , gametes are called sperm and egg cells .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle ' cell division process of mitosis , it differs in two important respects:	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete , compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome ( one received from each parent ) in each cell which results from mitosis .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	the outcome of meiosis is potentially four ( genetically unique ) haploid cells , compared with the two ( genetically identical ) diploid cells produced from mitosis .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organism 's mother and one from its father .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	The cell divides twice , potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	( `` Potentially '' because in some cases , such as the formation of oocytes in mammals , only one of the possible four haploid cells survives . )	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA , resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	This genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which natural selection can act , but , as described below in Section 6 , Origin and function of meiosis , the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	It is also noteworthy that during meiosis , specific genes are more highly transcribed , and these are called the meiome , the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing , synapse and recombination occur .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA ( the meiome ) , however , there are also pervasive translational controls ( e.g . selective usage of preformed mRNA ) , regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Thus , both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	Prior to the meiosis process the cell 's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication , creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome ( homologs ) two exact copies , sister chromatids , attached at the centromere region .	0
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle	In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other .	0

What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th century .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	Joseph Proust 's law of definite proportions and John Dalton 's atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	Lavoisier 's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The law of conservation of mass , or principle of mass conservation , states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy ( both of which have mass ) , the mass of the system must remain constant over time , as system mass can not change quantity if it is not added or removed .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	Hence , the quantity of mass is `` conserved '' over time .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed , although it may be rearranged in space , or the entities associated with it may be changed in form , as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The law implies ( requires ) that during any chemical reaction , nuclear reaction , or radioactive decay in an isolated system , the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry , mechanics , and fluid dynamics .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	Historically , mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century , and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory , but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations , even in modern practice .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved , the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important , since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e . those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	In this circumstance , the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation , which is the first law of thermodynamics .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	By contrast , for a thermodynamically closed system ( i.e. , one which is closed to exchanges of matter , but open to exchanges of non-material energy , such as heat and work , with the surroundings ) mass is ( usually ) only approximately conserved .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory , although the change is usually small , since relatively large amounts of such energy ( by comparison with ordinary experience ) carry only a small amount of mass ( again by ordinary standards of measurement ) .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	In special relativity , mass is not converted to energy , since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into , or out of , a system .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	However , certain types of matter ( a different concept ) may be converted to energy , so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	However , if such energy is removed from systems , they must lose the mass that is associated with it .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	In general relativity , mass ( and energy ) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept , subject to different definitions , and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space .	0
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	For a discussion , see mass in general relativity .	0

what can electrical energy be transformed into	Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to another .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	In physics , the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system , without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by Entropy .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Changes in total energy of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them , as energy is a quantity which is conserved , according to the first law of thermodynamics .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	According to special relativity , changes in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the system 's mass , and the total amount of mass of a system is a measure of its energy .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state , or a different type of energy .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Energy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Energy may be used in natural processes or machines , or else to provide some service to society ( such as heat , light , or motion ) .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	For example , an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat , which is then transformed into the propulsive energy ( kinetic energy that moves a vehicle ) .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	A solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computer .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	The generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another , is a transducer .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	In general , most types of energy , save for thermal energy , may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energy .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Sometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 % , such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum , or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object , in space .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Conversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency ( many types of friction do this ) .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Exceptions for perfect conversion efficiency ( even for isolated systems ) occur when energy has already been partly distributed among many available quantum states for a collection of particles , which are freely allowed to explore any state of momentum and position ( phase space ) .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	In such circumstances , a measure called Entropy , or evening-out of energy distribution in such states , dictates that future states of the system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	( There is no way , taking the universe as a whole , to collect energy into fewer states , once it has spread to them ) .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	A consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy , since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Such energy is sometimes considered `` degraded energy , '' because it is not entirely usable .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that , for this reason , thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 % , only if the entropy ( even-ness or disorder ) of the universe is increased by other means , to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content .	0
what can electrical energy be transformed into	Otherwise , only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy ( and thus , useful work ) , since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature , in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy .	0

what are use taxes ?	A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means , if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor , you owe use tax .	1
what are use taxes ?	You must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered .	0
what are use taxes ?	Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item ( without paying sales tax ) and store it in your warehouse initially , use tax applies to that location where goods were stored .	0
what are use taxes ?	Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location , you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption .	0
what are use taxes ?	This really means that you do n't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction .	0
what are use taxes ?	It is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products/services .	0
what are use taxes ?	If vendor does n't charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication .	0
what are use taxes ?	Use Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is different .	0
what are use taxes ?	Use tax is also termed as `` Consumption Tax '' or `` Consumer Use Tax '' .	1
what are use taxes ?	A use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments .	1
what are use taxes ?	It is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use , storage , or consumption in that state ( not for resale ) , regardless of where the purchase took place .	0
what are use taxes ?	If a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state , full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction .	0
what are use taxes ?	The use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home state 's sales tax .	0
what are use taxes ?	Usually , this is due to out-of-state purchases , as well as ordering items through the mail , by phone , or over the Internet from other states .	0
what are use taxes ?	The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed ( if any ) had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence .	0
what are use taxes ?	For example , a resident of Massachusetts , with a 6.25 % `` sales and use tax '' on certain goods and services , purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use , storage or other consumption in Massachusetts .	0
what are use taxes ?	Under New Hampshire law , the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods , but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax .	0
what are use taxes ?	If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase , whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted ( as a tax credit ) from the 6.25 % owed for subsequent use , storage or consumption in Massachusetts .	0
what are use taxes ?	With few exceptions , no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state , meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax .	0
what are use taxes ?	The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods .	0
what are use taxes ?	The assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually , but some states require a monthly payment .	0
what are use taxes ?	For example , where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state , Vermont law requires filing a tax return ( Form SU-452 and payment ) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $ 50 late fee , a 5 % penalty per month , to a maximum of 25 % , plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties .	0
what are use taxes ?	Typical exemptions include purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental agencies , purchases for resale in commerce , and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business .	0
what are use taxes ?	Also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable .	0
what are use taxes ?	As an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on `` pre-written '' ( not custom ) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts , regardless of where it originates .	0
what are use taxes ?	However , the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service '' .	0
what are use taxes ?	In contrast , Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet ( such as downloaded software or music ) , except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services '' .	0
what are use taxes ?	Software ( pre-written or custom ) `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' ( i.e. , on disk ) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online , except `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable `` programming services '' even if delivered on a disk .	0
what are use taxes ?	In most cases , this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location , remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them , if the company has a presence or `` nexus '' in every state ( as large `` brick-and-mortar '' sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do ) .	0

when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The current model of the sub-atomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The plum pudding model of the atom by J. J. Thomson , who discovered the electron in 1897 , was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model .	1
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In this model , the atom is composed of electrons ( which Thomson still called `` corpuscles '' , though G. J. Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 ) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons ' negative charges , like negatively charged `` plums `` surrounded by positively charged `` pudding `` .	0

when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge ( in the case of gold , enough to balance about 100 electrons ) , thus leading to the Rutherford model of the atom .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Although gold has an atomic number of 79 , immediately after Rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den Broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear charge .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	The matter required experiment to decide .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Henry Moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 ( see Moseley 's law ) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number ( Moseley found only one unit difference ) , and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and Rutherford .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	This work culminated in the solar-system-like ( but quantum-limited ) Bohr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Bohr had also inspired Moseley 's work .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson 's model was compared ( though not by Thomson ) to a British dessert called plum pudding , hence the name .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson 's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine , the leading British science journal of the day .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In Thomson 's view : ... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , ...	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In this model , the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud , it felt a larger net positive inward force , because there was more material of opposite charge , inside its orbit ( see Gauss 's law ) .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	In Thomson 's model , electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons , and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements , but was not notably successful at this .	0
when did thomson make the plum-pudding model	Still , Thomson 's model ( along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn 's rings ) , were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom .	0

where translation on DNA happens	Overview of the translation of eukaryotic messenger RNA	0
where translation on DNA happens	Diagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome	0
where translation on DNA happens	In molecular biology and genetics , translation is the process through which cellular ribosomes manufacture proteins .	0
where translation on DNA happens	It is part of the process of gene expression .	0
where translation on DNA happens	In translation , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain , or polypeptide , that will later fold into an active protein .	0
where translation on DNA happens	In bacteria , translation occurs in the cell 's cytoplasm , where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located , and bind to the mRNA .	0
where translation on DNA happens	In eukaryotes , translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis .	0
where translation on DNA happens	The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA .	0
where translation on DNA happens	The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is `` read '' by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape .	0
where translation on DNA happens	In many instances , the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and releases the nascent protein polypeptide inside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Many types of transcribed RNA , such as transfer RNA , ribosomal RNA , and small nuclear RNA , do not undergo translation into proteins .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Translation proceeds in four phases : initiation , elongation , translocation and termination ( all describing the growth of the amino acid chain , or polypeptide that is the product of translation ) .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins .	0
where translation on DNA happens	In activation , the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA ( tRNA ) .	0
where translation on DNA happens	The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3 ' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond .	0
where translation on DNA happens	When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it , it is termed `` charged '' .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5 ' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors ( IF ) .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon ( UAA , UAG , or UGA ) .	0
where translation on DNA happens	No tRNA can recognize or bind to this codon .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Instead , the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex .	0
where translation on DNA happens	A number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation ; these include anisomycin , cycloheximide , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , streptomycin , erythromycin , and puromycin , among others .	0
where translation on DNA happens	Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes , and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host 's cells .	0

what are rocker arms ?	Rocker arm	0
what are rocker arms ?	Generally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive , marine , motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines , the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it .	1
what are rocker arms ?	One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft ( either directly or via a tappet ( lifter ) and pushrod ) while the other end acts on the valve stem .	0
what are rocker arms ?	When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm , the inside presses down on the valve stem , opening the valve .	0
what are rocker arms ?	When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation , the inside rises , allowing the valve spring to close the valve .	0
what are rocker arms ?	The drive cam is driven by the camshaft .	0

who rules communism government	A communist state is a state where the means of production are collectively owned by the society .	0
who rules communism government	It has a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party ( referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents ) and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist–Leninist ideology as the guiding principle of the state .	1
who rules communism government	Technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless .	0
who rules communism government	From this perspective , the term Marxist-Leninist state is more appropriate .	0
who rules communism government	Historically , a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today , a communist state can also , for instance , refer to contemporary China and Vietnam , where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy .	0

who rules communism government	Consequently , the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined , such as in the development of parallel institutions .	0
who rules communism government	In the 20th century , most communist states adopted planned economies .	0
who rules communism government	However , there were exceptions : The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management , while China , Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s .	0

what is water jet propulsion	A rider on a Yamaha Waverunner XL performing a high-speed turn .	0
what is water jet propulsion	A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat , a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat , then expels it through a nozzle at the stern .	1
what is water jet propulsion	Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton ( who developed a waterjet in 1954 ) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes , generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Unlike these previous waterjet developments , such as Campini 's and the Hanley Hydrojet , Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water , and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution .	0
what is water jet propulsion	From this , the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Through further developments , it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types , and as such , waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels , including passenger ferries , rescue craft , patrol boats and offshore supply vessels .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Jetboats are highly maneuverable , and many can , from full speed , be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length , in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop '' .	0
what is water jet propulsion	The well known Hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is cut , the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again , causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water .	0
what is water jet propulsion	There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats , though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds , up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this , the extra hull resistance generated by struts , rudders , shafts ( etc . ) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range ( up to ) .	0
what is water jet propulsion	Also , in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds ( such as tug boats ) , the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical .	0
what is water jet propulsion	For these reasons , the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught , maneuverability , and load flexibility are main concerns .	0
what is water jet propulsion	The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry .	0
what is water jet propulsion	South Africa 's s ( approximately long ) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far .	0

what is the purpose of vitamin d	Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin , it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense , as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight .	0
what is the purpose of vitamin d	( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet . )	0
what is the purpose of vitamin d	An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from their diet .	0
what is the purpose of vitamin d	However , as with other compounds commonly called vitamins , vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease , namely , rickets , the childhood form of osteomalacia .	0
what is the purpose of vitamin d	Additionally , like other compounds called vitamins , in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods , such as milk , to avoid disease due to deficiency .	0
