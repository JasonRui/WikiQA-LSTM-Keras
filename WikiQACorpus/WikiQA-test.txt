how are antibodies used in	Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key .	0
how are antibodies used in	An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .	1
how are antibodies used in	The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen .	1
how are antibodies used in	Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision .	1
how are antibodies used in	Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) .	1
how are antibodies used in	The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .	0
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .	0
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor ( BCR ) .	0
how are antibodies used in	The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure .	0
how are antibodies used in	In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding .	0
how are antibodies used in	Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .	0
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably .	0
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .	0
how are antibodies used in	There are several different types of antibody heavy chains , and several different kinds of antibodies , which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess .	0
how are antibodies used in	Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals , which perform different roles , and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter .	0
how are antibodies used in	Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist .	0
how are antibodies used in	This region is known as the hypervariable region .	0
how are antibodies used in	Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .	0
how are antibodies used in	This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .	0
how are antibodies used in	The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity .	0
how are antibodies used in	Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region .	0
how are antibodies used in	This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system .	0

WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability asks how much genetics are playing a role in differences in height between people .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	This is not the same as asking how much genetics influences height in any one person.The	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences .	1
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Factors including genetics , environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation between individuals in their observable characteristics ( in their `` phenotypes `` ) .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability thus analyzes the relative contributions of differences in genetic and non-genetic factors to the total phenotypic variance in a population .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	For instance , some humans in a population are taller than others ; heritability attempts to identify how much genetics are playing a role in part of the population being extra tall .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics , particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics ( for instance twin studies ) , but is less widely used in population genetics .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	This is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	In addition , heritability can change without any genetic change occurring ( e.g . when the environment starts contributing to more variation ) .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	A case in point , consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases , causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show different levels of intelligence ) .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	On the other hand , heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases , causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show more similar levels of intelligence ) .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation , or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation ; what matters is the relative contribution .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	The extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype , making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity , which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes .	0
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	However , there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment .	0

what is `` data ingestion ''	Given that the same byte pattern may occur dozens , hundreds , or even thousands of times ( the match frequency is dependent on the chunk size ) , the amount of data that must be stored or transferred can be greatly reduced .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	This type of deduplication is different from that performed by standard file-compression tools , such as LZ77 and LZ78 .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	Whereas these tools identify short repeated substrings inside individual files , the intent of storage-based data deduplication is to inspect large volumes of data and identify large sections – such as entire files or large sections of files – that are identical , in order to store only one copy of it .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	This copy may be additionally compressed by single-file compression techniques .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	For example a typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same one megabyte ( MB ) file attachment .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	Each time the email platform is backed up , all 100 instances of the attachment are saved , requiring 100 MB storage space .	0
what is `` data ingestion ''	With data deduplication , only one instance of the attachment is actually stored ; the subsequent instances are referenced back to the saved copy for deduplication ratio of roughly 100 to 1 .	0

what is atherosclerotic heart disease	The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Atherosclerotic lesions , or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories : Stable and unstable ( also called vulnerable ) .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally , stable atherosclerotic plaques , which tend to be asymptomatic , are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while , unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen ( also known as the fibrous cap ) is usually weak and prone to rupture .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material , such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Upon formation , intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright ( i.e . coronary occlusion ) , but more often they detach , move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism ( i.e . Stroke is often caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries ) .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Interestingly , chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue ( s ) is insufficient resulting in ischemia .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic , slowly progressive and cumulative .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Most commonly , soft plaque suddenly ruptures ( see vulnerable plaque ) , causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow , leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	This catastrophic event is called an infarction .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction ( a heart attack ) .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs , typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree , but mostly larger , high-pressure vessels such as the coronary , renal , femoral , cerebral , and carotid arteries .	0
what is atherosclerotic heart disease	These are termed `` clinically silent `` because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help , or when they do , physicians do not recognize what has happened .	0
